No landscape is devoid of power (Mozingo, Interview. 2022), Before the industrial revolution and the widespread of capitalisim as the accepted economical model, there was a different philosophy in terms of how the land was viewed. There was economic disparity but it was not abysmal, people shared a land that was called common lands and were able to earn a living, No one owned the common lands, but everyone had the right to grow crops and sustain themselves and have commerce among each other. (Lnd Arch 170, Class Fall 2022) 

When analizing matters of power and priviledge, we dive into land ownership and how our societies place value and prestige according to our capitalist society and in recent years neoliberal projects (Harvey, Podcast 2018). 
These policies have altered the form of our cities, where the economic center of soceties was. As the world transitioned from the common lands into the era of industrialization, those people that relied on the common lands became homeless and unable to sustain themselves, at this point industries opened up and gave employment to the displaced people, creating the working society in the industrialized city. 
As Harvey mentioned Indeed, social justice and urbanism are related to each other and it is important to identify this connection thought the transformation of the city, from beacon of innovation and technology, to a place of derelict and decay, and eventually to modern times looking at downtownâ€™s renovation. Land uses changed to accommodate the needs of the cities at the time and with this, houwing for the working class near their places of employment was developed, as the affluent people fled to the suburbs, marginalized people were left to suffer the injustices of polluted communities (Jason Corburun).
Downtown and other centrally located areas were inhabited by historically marginalized communities, as the economy shifts and is now favoring centrally located land, redevelopment has flourished in many downtown areas where the locals are not longer able to keep up with the land values the market established and are being displaced, as their own neiborhood is now being gentrified. 

The urban displacement project is a very interesting project that uses census data to track portions of a city and to see their risk: 
Vulnerability, Gentrification, Displacement, Exclusion, the last 3 factors have a yes or no gradient, but vulnerability has 9 values, that gives us a better understanding of the gradual process of gentrification. 

Below is the criteria for the study and mapping project. 
Vulnerability
Has at least 4 of 7 vulnerable factors in 2001: 
-Housing value < regional median
-% college educated  < regional median
-% renters > regional median
-% overcrowded housing units > regional median
-Infrastructure quality < regional median
-Housing quality< regional median

Gentrification
Has both of the factors from 2001 to 2010
-%increase in college-educated households >= city meaan
-% increase in land value >= city mean

Displacement
% loss of people who have up to a high school education< city mean

Exclusion
-Areas NOT classified as either gentrification or displacement 
AND
-% college-educatedin 2010 >= city mean 



The mapping efforts I am interested involved a multinational region, this is a unique region, because I am trying to map how the landscape of this region is changing as underrepresented people are being displaced from their origin and encroaching into an already marginalized population and marginalizing even further the underserved population of a developing contry. 
The story map of Emily Marye Runnels is very close to what I want to achieve but with a different methodology. 
I would like to include housing data from the same source on key locations, with specific socioeconomic development to be able to compare price points. As well as establish a cost of living price for both cities to have an idea of the dynamics between wage and aquisition power. Then, I would also try to use census data to see how the same area has changed over time, unfortunately census data from two different countries might not measure the same parameters, therefore I will have to find commonalities between census and extrapolate from this point.
